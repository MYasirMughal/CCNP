Categorization of all the routing types and link them logically to show their relationships:


---

1. Based on Route Learning Method (Main Types)

Dynamic Routing can be further categorized based on protocol behavior and administrative scope.



---

2. Subcategories of Dynamic Routing

A. Based on Routing Protocol Type

Relationship:

These protocol types belong only to Dynamic Routing since they deal with automatic learning and updating of routes.



---

B. Based on Administrative Control (Scope of Routing)

Relationship:

IGP and EGP apply only to Dynamic Routing since they manage the automatic exchange of routes.

IGP uses Distance Vector or Link-State protocols (RIP, OSPF, etc.).

EGP mainly uses Path-Vector protocols (BGP).



---

3. Relationship of Other Routing Types

A. Based on Network Structure

B. Based on Route Utilization

C. Based on Route Optimization

Final Categorization (Linking Everything Together)

Static Routing

Manual, fixed, used in small networks.

Can work with Flat Routing, Unicast, and Load Balancing.


Dynamic Routing

Uses Routing Protocol Types (Distance Vector, Link-State, Path-Vector).

Can be IGP (internal networks) or EGP (external networks like BGP).

Supports Hierarchical Routing, Load Balancing, and QoS-based routing.

Used in Multicast, Anycast, and Broadcast routing.


Default Routing

Used in both Static & Dynamic routing for handling unknown destinations.




---

Conclusion

Static Routing is independent and does not have protocol-based subtypes.

Dynamic Routing is further categorized into protocol types (Distance Vector, Link-State, Path-Vector) and administrative control types (IGP, EGP).

Other classifications (network structure, route utilization, and optimization) apply to both Static and Dynamic Routing, depending on use cases.
